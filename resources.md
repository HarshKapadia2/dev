        -   The image/video/audio value has to be a URL _to a file_ (Eg: `https://harshkapadia.me/static/img/og-img.png`) and NOT a relative link (Eg: `static/img/og-img.png`) to a file in the project.

-   [Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI)
-   [Margin vs padding](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-margin-and-vs-padding)
-   [`box-sizing` property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp)

-   [Pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements)
-   Specificity
    -   Order: `!important` > `inline` > `id selectors` > `class selectors + attribute selectors + pseudo-classes` > `element selectors (tags) + pseudo-elements`
    -   The number of ids, classes and tags for a particular element matter in the specifity as well. More of each implies an increase in specificity.
    -   `!important` trumps all, irrespective of the number of ids, classes and tags. Should be avoided as far as possible.
    -   Inline CSS trumps all but `!important`, irrespective of the number of ids, classes and tags. Should be avoided as far as possible.
    -   [Specificity illustrated](https://specifishity.com) (Format: `(<no_of_ids>, <no_of_classes+attribute_selectors+pseudo-classes>, <no_of_tags+pseudo-elements>)`)
        -   Most pseudo classes have the same specificity as a class. `is` and `where` are exceptions, with `where` having zero specificity and `is` using the highest value from its list.

-   [Customizing the install experience](https://web.dev/customize-install)
-   The Application tab in the Dev Tools can be used to check the service worker status and the manifest.
-   Use LightHouse for debugging and checking.
-   Service Workers are not just used for PWAs. They are used just for caching as well.
-   Caching is an important concept for PWAs. Please go through [Caching section](#caching) below.
-   In a PWA, static files need to be manually cached during the install event, because the Service Worker is not active by then to cache the initial response. Also, every file has to be listed individually, as directories are not recognized.
-   Once a PWA is installed, the icons cannot be changed. The change is reflected on re-installing the PWA. (I think TWAs can change their icons. Check the [TWA section](#twa) below for more info.)
-   An offline PWA does not have access to Local Storage. (The service worker does not allow it.) IndexedDB can be used in place. ([IndexedDB section](#indexeddb) below.)

    -   The [`Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) can't be wildcarded (`*`) and the `Authorization` header always needs to be listed explicitly.
        -   Side note: If the `Content-Type` request header's value is `application/json`, add it to the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` response header. ([Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#:~:text=The%20only%20type/subtype%20combinations%20allowed%20for%20the%20media%20type%20specified%20in%20the%20Content%2DType%20header%20are%3A))
    -   The [`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods) can't be wildcarded (`*`) and all the allowed [HTTP request methods](https://networking.harshkapadia.me/http#http-request-methodsverbs) need to be listed explicitly.
    -   The [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) can't be wildcarded (`*`) and the origin always needs to be listed explicitly.

        -   This header needs to not only be sent in the response to the preflight request, but in the response to the the actual request as well.
    -   The [`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials) needs to be sent
        -   [In response to the preflight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#requests_with_credentials) and in response to the actual request after the preflight request as well.
        -   [In response to the simple (non-preflighted) requests that require authorization.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#:~:text=Line%207%20shows,invoking%20web%20content.)
    -   In Fetch, the [`credentials: "include"` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#credentials) has to be added.
        -   This option is what adds the strictness of adding non-wildcarded values to each of the response headers.
        -   [Fetch does not send any Cookies by default](https://medium.com/cameron-nokes/4-common-mistakes-front-end-developers-make-when-using-fetch-1f974f9d1aa1#:~:text=Unlike%20XHR%2C%20fetch%20does%20not%20include%20any%20cookies%20in%20the%20request%20by%20default.) and [this option makes the browser send 1st and 3rd party Cookies to the server](https://zellwk.com/blog/handling-cookies-with-fetchs-credentials/#:~:text=domains%20or%20subdomains.-,If%20you%20set,3rd%20party%20cookies%20set%20by%20a%20specific%20domain%20that%20domain%E2%80%99s%20server.,-Access%2DControl%2DAllow).
    -   When using Fetch, remember to return appropriate CORS headers with the error response as well, otherwise the Fetch call itself will fail and the actual error will not be caught.
        -   A CORS error will pop up for errors returned without appropriate CORS headers, instead of returning the actual error and that can get very confusing.

-   Refresh Tokens
    -   [What Are Refresh Tokens and How to Use Them Securely](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them)
    -   [How to Handle Refresh Tokens](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/194774/how-to-handle-refresh-tokens)
    -   Refresh Tokens are tokens with a longer expiry duration than Access Tokens.
    -   If the Refresh Token is expired, then the user has to manually log in.
    -   They are used to
        -   Reduce the number of explicit logins that the client has to make.
        -   Reduce the load of querying/storing authorization details in the database every time a user needs access.
    -   There is a tradeoff between security and database storage/querying.
        -   If better security is required, the Refresh Tokens need to be stored in the database and marked as expired once a new one is issued. This increases database querying, but improves security and still maintains the convenience of less number of logins for the client.
        -   Another way to provide security would be to issue a new Refresh Token every time a new Access Token is issued, but this increases the number of Refresh Tokens that have to be stored in the database (to expire them later as discussed in the previous point). So database storage is increased, but this improves security and still maintains the convenience of less number of logins for the client.
            -   Storing Refresh Tokens is still better than storing a Session Token, because a Session Token is checked every time an API call is made. Now if there are too many Refresh Tokens, database storage increases and querying takes time, but that is a trade off that has to be decided upon.
            -   A hybrid approach can be taken, where a Session Token (as a short-lived JWT) can be issued and stored in the database along with a Refresh Token and so the Session Token does not have to be checked with the DB on every request. A new Session Token can be issued whenever it expires, using the Refresh Token.

-   [What are Unicode, UTF-8, and UTF-16?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2241348/what-are-unicode-utf-8-and-utf-16)

##### New Lines/Line Endings

-   Also called 'Newline' and 'line break'.
-   Types
    -   Carriage Return
        -   Unicode and ASCII: `CR`
        -   Programming languages: `\r`
        -   Hexadecimal: `0D`, `0x0D`
        -   [More details](https://www.asciihex.com/character/control/13/0x0D/cr-carriage-return)
    -   Line Feed
        -   Unicode and ASCII: `LF`
        -   Programming languages: `\n`
        -   Hexadecimal: `0A`, `0x0A`
        -   [More details](https://www.asciihex.com/character/control/10/0x0A/lf-line-feed)
    -   Carriage Return and Line Feed
        -   Unicode and ASCII: `CRLF`, `CR+LF`
        -   Programming languages: `\r\n`
        -   Hexadecimal: `0D 0A`, `0x0D 0x0A`
    -   End of Line
        -   Unicode: `EOL`
    -   Next Line
        -   Unicode: `NEL`
    -   New Line
        -   EBCDIC: `NL`
-   > ...different system uses different line break. Carriage Return is used on old Macintosh operating systems. UNIX based systems including Linux and Mac OS X use Line Feed, while most of non-Unix operating systems use End of Line (`\r\n`). Therefore, good code should handle all kind of line breaks.
