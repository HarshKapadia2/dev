# My web dev path

Everyone has their own journey and this has been mine up till now!

## My method of learning

- Side-by-side method
   - Do what is done in the tutorial at the same time.
   - Make short notes in comments for future reference.
- If you encounter errors, document them and write the solution for future reference (preserve links as well).
- Make a project using that tech as soon as you're done learning it, use GitHub as a part of your dev process.
- Tell people what you're learning. The more that people know, the better.
   - Add projects on LinkedIn as posts and in the projects section.
   - Be active on Twitter.
- Participate in Tech communitites. (Shameless plug: [Our Tech Community](https://ourtech.community))
- Keep in mind
   - [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html)
   - [Choose Boring Technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology)
   - [Presentation and Documentation](https://undirected-graph.netlify.app/posts/presentation)
   - [The Key to a Good Life? Lose Yourself in Something.](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-key-to-a-good-life-lose-yourself-in-something)
   - [PewDiePie's Philosophical Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDKFkBlUzOnbm0o8ktgoyz1OvrN8gFUA)

## My working process

Learn and apply in an infinite loop.

- Get an idea. (It doesn't have to be awesome or unique.)
- Plan (Find a neat and easy solution to the problem.)
- Learn the basics (from a small tutorial or the documentation).
- Build a basic template.
- Loop infinitely
   - Plan
   - Learn the feature that you require.
   - Implement it in the product.
   - Test.

> TIP: Don't do long courses or tutorial series.
