# My web dev path

Everyone has their own journey and this has been mine up till now!

## My method of learning

-   Side-by-side method
    -   Do what is done in the tutorial at the same time.
    -   Make short notes in comments for future reference.
-   If you encounter errors, document them and write the solution for future reference (preserve links as well).
-   Make a project using that tech as soon as you're done learning it, use GitHub as a part of your dev process.
-   Tell people what you're learning. The more that people know, the better.
    -   Add projects on LinkedIn as posts and in the projects section.
    -   Be active on Twitter.
-   Participate in Tech communitites. (Shameless plug: [Our Tech Community](https://ourtech.community))
-   Keep in mind

## My working process

Learn and apply in an infinite loop.

-   Get an idea. (It doesn't have to be awesome or unique.)
-   Plan (Find a neat and easy solution to the problem.)
-   Learn the basics (from a small tutorial or the documentation).
-   Build a basic template.
-   Loop infinitely
    -   Plan
    -   Learn the feature that you require.
    -   Implement it in the product.
    -   Test.

> TIP: Don't do long courses or tutorial series.
